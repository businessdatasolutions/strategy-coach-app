# Issue: Auto-focus Input Field After AI Response

## Problem Description
After the AI Strategic Co-pilot provides a response, the cursor should automatically move to the dialog input field to improve user experience and conversation flow. Currently, users must manually click on the input field to continue the conversation.

## Current Behavior
- User sends a message
- AI responds with strategic guidance
- Input field remains unfocused
- User must manually click on the input field to type the next message

## Expected Behavior
- User sends a message
- AI responds with strategic guidance
- **Input field automatically receives focus**
- User can immediately start typing the next message without clicking

## User Experience Impact
- **Severity**: Low (UX enhancement)
- **Priority**: Low (nice-to-have improvement)
- **User Impact**: Minor inconvenience requiring extra click/tab to continue conversation

## Technical Implementation
The fix should be implemented in the `sendMessage()` function in `web/index.html`:

```javascript
// In the finally block after AI response is processed
finally {
    this.isTyping = false;
    
    // Auto-focus input field for better UX
    this.$nextTick(() => {
        const inputField = document.querySelector('input[type="text"]');
        if (inputField) {
            inputField.focus();
        }
    });
}
```

## Alternative Solutions
1. **Focus on message completion**: Focus input when `isTyping` becomes false
2. **Focus with delay**: Add small delay to ensure UI has updated
3. **Focus on scroll completion**: Focus after chat scrolls to bottom

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Input field automatically receives focus after AI response
- [ ] Focus works on both desktop and mobile browsers
- [ ] Focus doesn't interfere with other UI interactions
- [ ] Focus is cancelled if user interacts with other elements during AI response

## Testing Scenarios
1. Send message → AI responds → Input field is focused
2. Send multiple messages rapidly → Each response refocuses input
3. Click elsewhere while AI is responding → Focus behavior should be appropriate
4. Mobile testing → Virtual keyboard behavior with auto-focus

## Browser Compatibility
- Chrome/Edge: Should work with standard `focus()` method
- Firefox: Test for any focus quirks
- Safari: Test on both desktop and mobile
- Mobile browsers: Consider virtual keyboard implications

## Related Features
- Could be extended to focus input when "New Session" is clicked
- Could include visual indication when input is focused
- Could be part of broader keyboard navigation improvements

## Resolution
Implemented auto-focus functionality in the `sendMessage()` function's finally block:
```javascript
finally {
    this.isTyping = false;
    
    // Auto-focus input field for better UX
    this.$nextTick(() => {
        const inputField = document.querySelector('input[type="text"]');
        if (inputField) {
            inputField.focus();
        }
    });
}
```
