# Business Cases for Testing

This directory contains business case documentation used by the Testing Agent to simulate realistic user interactions.

## Structure

- Each business case should be a separate markdown file
- Files should contain company background, user persona details, and strategic context
- The Testing Agent will use this information to generate authentic responses during the WHY → HOW → WHAT journey

## Usage

The Testing Agent reads these business cases to:
1. Build realistic user personas
2. Generate contextually appropriate responses to agent questions
3. Simulate authentic strategic thinking patterns
4. Test phase transitions with realistic confirmations
5. Support incremental testing of individual agents/phases during development
6. Test partial journeys (e.g., WHY phase only, WHY→HOW, etc.)
