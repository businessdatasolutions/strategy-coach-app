## Technical Implementation

### Testing Agent Architecture

**Agent Core Engine**
```python
class StrategicTestingAgent:
    def __init__(self, business_case: BusinessCase):
        self.business_case = business_case
        self.persona = self._create_persona()
        self.context_memory = ContextMemory()
        self.response_generator = ResponseGenerator()
        
    def generate_response(self, coach_message: str) -> str:
        """Generate authentic user response based on business case context."""
        context = self._extract_relevant_context(coach_message)
        persona_filter = self._apply_persona_characteristics()
        return self._generate_contextual_response(context, persona_filter)
        
    def should_provide_detail(self, topic: str) -> bool:
        """Determine if agent should reveal more information about topic."""
        return self._evaluate_disclosure_readiness(topic)
```

**Journey Orchestration**
```python
class JourneySimulator:
    def __init__(self, agent: StrategicTestingAgent, recorder: JourneyRecorder):
        self.agent = agent
        self.recorder = recorder
        self.session_id = None
        
    async def run_complete_journey(self) -> JourneyReport:
        """Execute full strategic coaching simulation."""
        await self._initialize_session()
        
        journey_phases = ["why_discovery", "how_analysis", "what_planning"]
        
        for phase in journey_phases:
            await self._simulate_phase(phase)
            self.recorder.capture_phase_completion(phase)
            
        return self._generate_journey_report()
```

### Recording Infrastructure

**Snapshot Capture System**
```python
class JourneyRecorder:
    def __init__(self, output_dir: Path):
        self.output_dir = output_dir
        self.session_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
        self.snapshots = []
        
    def capture_conversation_snapshot(self, message_pair: Dict):
        """Record text-based conversation interaction."""
        
    def capture_ui_snapshot(self, description: str):
        """Take screenshot of current UI state."""
        
    def capture_state_snapshot(self, strategy_map: Dict, agent_state: Dict):
        """Record system state and strategy progression."""
        
    def generate_journey_report(self) -> JourneyReport:
        """Create comprehensive test report with all snapshots."""
```
