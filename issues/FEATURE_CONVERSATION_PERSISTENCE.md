# Feature: Conversation Persistence and Resumption

## Overview

Enable users to exit strategic coaching conversations and resume them later with full context preservation, allowing for flexible, multi-session strategic development journeys.

## Feature Description

Users can pause their strategic coaching sessions at any point and return later to continue exactly where they left off. All conversation history, strategy map progress, agent context, and session state are automatically preserved and restored.

## User Experience

### Conversation Exit Flow
```
User: [Closes browser or navigates away]
System: Automatically saves all session state
User: [Returns hours/days later]
System: "Welcome back! Let's continue your strategic journey where we left off..."
```

### Resume Experience
```
AI: "When we last spoke, we were exploring your core beliefs about empowering small businesses. You had mentioned wanting to democratize access to powerful tools.

Your current progress:
â€¢ WHY Discovery: 65% complete
â€¢ Core Purpose: Defined âœ“
â€¢ Beliefs: In progress
â€¢ Next: Complete belief exploration

Would you like to continue from where we left off, or would you prefer to review what we've discovered so far?"
```

## Technical Implementation

### Current State (Partial Support)
The system already has foundational persistence:
- âœ… **Strategy Maps**: Saved as JSON per session (`data/sessions/{session_id}_strategy_map.json`)
- âœ… **Session Management**: UUID-based session tracking
- âœ… **API Endpoints**: Session retrieval capabilities

### Required Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Session Persistence
```python
class SessionState:
    """Complete session state for persistence."""
    session_id: str
    conversation_history: List[Message]
    strategy_map_path: str
    current_phase: str
    current_agent: str
    completeness_percentage: float
    user_context: Dict[str, Any]
    agent_insights: Dict[str, Any]
    interactive_state: Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
    last_activity: datetime
    session_metadata: Dict[str, Any]
```

### 2. Conversation History Persistence
```python
# Enhanced session storage
{
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "created_at": "2025-08-16T10:00:00Z",
  "last_activity": "2025-08-16T15:30:00Z",
  "conversation_history": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I want to develop our strategy...",
      "timestamp": "2025-08-16T10:05:00Z"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant", 
      "content": "Let's explore your WHY...",
      "timestamp": "2025-08-16T10:05:15Z",
      "agent": "why_agent",
      "interactive_elements": null
    }
  ],
  "current_state": {
    "phase": "why",
    "agent": "why_agent", 
    "completeness": 45.2,
    "stage": "belief_exploration"
  },
  "strategy_map_reference": "sessions/{session_id}_strategy_map.json"
}
```

### 3. Resume Context Generation
```python
class ResumeContextGenerator:
    """Generate context-aware resume messages."""
    
    def generate_resume_message(self, session_state: SessionState) -> str:
        """Create personalized resume message with progress context."""
        
        last_interaction = self._get_last_meaningful_exchange()
        progress_summary = self._summarize_progress()
        next_focus = self._determine_next_focus()
        
        return f"""Welcome back! Let's continue your strategic journey.
        
        When we last spoke, we were {last_interaction}.
        
        Your progress so far:
        {progress_summary}
        
        {next_focus}
        
        Would you like to continue where we left off?"""
```

        time_elapsed = datetime.now() - session.last_activity
        
        if time_elapsed < timedelta(hours=2):
            return "direct_continuation"  # Continue immediately
        elif time_elapsed < timedelta(days=1): 
            return "brief_recap"  # Quick summary then continue
        elif time_elapsed < timedelta(weeks=1):
            return "progress_review"  # Review progress, then continue
