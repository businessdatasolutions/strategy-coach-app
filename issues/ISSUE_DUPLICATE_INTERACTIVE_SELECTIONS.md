# Issue: Duplicate Interactive Selection Dialog Boxes

## Problem Description
The interactive selection dialog box with core beliefs checkboxes is being duplicated and continuously added to AI responses. Each new AI message creates another identical selection interface instead of updating the existing one or showing it only once.

## Current Behavior
- User receives AI response with interactive selection dialog
- Next AI response adds another identical dialog box below the previous one
- Multiple identical selection interfaces accumulate in the chat
- All dialog boxes remain functional but create visual clutter
- User confusion about which dialog to use

## Expected Behavior
- Interactive selection dialog should appear **only once** per conversation topic
- Subsequent AI responses should either:
  - Update the existing dialog with new relevant choices
  - Remove the dialog if no longer needed
  - Reference the existing dialog without duplicating it

## Visual Evidence
Screenshots show duplicate selection interfaces with identical options:
- "People are our greatest asset" (Category: human)
- "Innovation drives sustainable growth" (Category: strategy) 
- "Customer success is our success" (Category: customer)
- "Technology should empower, not complicate" (Category: technology)
- "Transparency builds trust" (Category: values)
- "Small businesses deserve enterprise tools" (Category: market)
- "Continuous learning fuels excellence" (Category: culture)
- "Collaboration multiplies impact" (Category: teamwork)
- "Quality over quantity always" (Category: standards)
- "Sustainability is non-negotiable" (Category: responsibility)

## User Experience Impact
- **Severity**: Medium (affects conversation flow and clarity)
- **Priority**: Medium (should be fixed soon)
- **User Impact**: Visual clutter and confusion about interface interaction

## Technical Root Cause
The AI is likely generating the same HTML interactive elements in each response instead of:
1. Tracking whether an interactive element is already present
2. Managing state of existing interactive elements
3. Updating existing elements rather than creating new ones

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Single Interactive Element Management
```javascript
// Track active interactive elements
activeInteractiveElements: new Set(),

// Before adding interactive content, check if it exists
addInteractiveElement(type, id) {
    if (this.activeInteractiveElements.has(id)) {
        // Update existing element instead of creating new one
        this.updateExistingElement(id);
    } else {
        // Create new element and track it
        this.createElement(type, id);
        this.activeInteractiveElements.add(id);
    }
}
```

### Solution 2: Response Context Awareness
- Modify AI prompts to be aware of existing interactive elements
- Include context about current UI state in conversation history
- Instruct AI to reference existing dialogs rather than recreate them

### Solution 3: Client-Side Deduplication
```javascript
// Remove duplicate interactive elements after each response
removeDuplicateInteractiveElements() {
    const selectionDialogs = document.querySelectorAll('.selection-dialog');
    if (selectionDialogs.length > 1) {
        // Keep only the most recent dialog
        for (let i = 0; i < selectionDialogs.length - 1; i++) {
            selectionDialogs[i].remove();
        }
    }
}
```

## Implementation Priority
This issue should be addressed as part of the interactive selection UI enhancement, focusing on:
1. State management for interactive elements
2. AI context awareness about existing UI components
3. Client-side deduplication as a safety measure

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Only one interactive selection dialog appears per conversation topic
- [ ] Dialog content updates appropriately with conversation context
- [ ] No duplicate or stale interactive elements in chat history
- [ ] Selection state is preserved when dialog is updated
- [ ] Clear visual indication when interactive elements are no longer relevant

## Testing Scenarios
1. Start conversation → Receive first interactive dialog → Verify single instance
2. Continue conversation → Verify no duplicate dialogs appear
3. Dialog updates with new relevant choices → Verify old dialog is replaced/updated
4. Complete dialog interaction → Verify dialog state is preserved or removed appropriately

- Alpine.js reactive state management
- AI response rendering pipeline
- Interactive selection component logic
- Conversation state management
