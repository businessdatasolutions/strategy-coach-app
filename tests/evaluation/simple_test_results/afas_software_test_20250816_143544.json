We've built something quite unique here over nearly three decades, and our culture of trust and family values isn't something I take lightly when considering outside perspectives.\n\n*pauses thoughtfully*\n\nThat said, I recognize that as we face these international expansion challenges and try to maintain our four-day workweek while competing against giants like SAP and Microsoft, maybe fresh eyes could be valuable. Our belief has always been that every entrepreneur deserves enterprise-level tools, and perhaps that includes this entrepreneur getting some strategic guidance.\n\nCould you repeat what you were saying? And maybe help me understand more concretely how you approach working with family-oriented businesses like ours? I need to know you truly understand what we've built here before we go deeper.\n\n*maintains steady eye contact, clearly still in evaluation mode*",

They see our numbers, they see our market position, and they think it's just about scaling up or copying what the big players do.\n\nBut what we've built here - this trust-based culture, our integrated approach, the way we actually eliminate administrative burdens instead of creating more - that's not something you can just replicate with a standard playbook.\n\n*looks directly at coach*\n\nSo before we go any further, help me understand - what's your take on what makes AFAS different?

At AFAS, we believe deeply that our culture - our \"Do, Trust, Crazy, Family\" values - is what sets us apart from the SAPs and Microsofts of the world.

We got here by trusting our people and staying true to our mission of inspiring better entrepreneurship.\n\nSo before we dive deep into strategy or whatever framework you typically use, I'd like to understand: do you actually get what makes AFAS different?
