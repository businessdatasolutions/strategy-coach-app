### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `strategy_map_agent.py` and `test_strategy_map_agent.py` in the same directory).
- Use `pytest` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the pytest configuration.
- This is a greenfield project using Python, LangChain, and LangGraph as specified in the PRD.
